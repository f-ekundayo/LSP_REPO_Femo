AI usage
I copied and pasted the questions from the word doc into ChatGPT and analyzed the answers i got back. 
it gave me some expected output;
Circle radius 3.0 → area = 28.274333882308138
Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = 10.0
Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = 30.0
Square side 4 → area = 16.0
Error: Radius must be greater than zero.
